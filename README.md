# Japan Tourist Weather App

A simple web application providing weather information for tourists visiting Japan for the first time.

## Technologies Used

- Laravel Framework v11.4.0
- Vue.js Framework v3.4.23

## Features

- Display current weather information for selected cities in Japan.
- Provide weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on different devices.
- Can search multiple cities.

## Why My UI/UX is the Best?

- **Easy to Use**: The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, making it effortless for users to find and access weather information.
- **Autocomplete of Cities**: I implemented an autocomplete feature for city search, enhancing user experience by quickly suggesting matching cities as they type.
- **Multiple City Weather Search**: Users can search for and view weather information for multiple cities simultaneously, improving efficiency and convenience.
- **Color-Coded Weather Cards**: Weather cards are color-coded based on the time of day, providing visual cues for day and night conditions. Dark backgrounds indicate nighttime, while light backgrounds signify daytime.
- **Delete Weather Cards**: Users have the option to remove weather cards they no longer need, allowing for customization and decluttering of the interface.
